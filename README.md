Smaller re-usable assets, likely not full solution accelerators, but useful notebooks and examples, 

### Instructions

Please give your asset it's own folder, add a readme for it with appropriate attribution, create a PR with a short explanation and request I review it. I'll add anything that doesn't automatically deploy. Please be careful adding devops/mlops work here - this is definitely the place for it, but make sure that hooks, github actions, etc. are disabled or written in ways that they won't trigger for people forking.

Currently this repo is public so only add things you're comfortable adding. We'll convert it once I figure out who is interested in contributing, but previously manually adding permissions for everyone was a huge blocker for involvement.

If noone else is interested, I'll use it personally. I'm making sections in the readme. If people start using it I'll add a deployable catalog that starts with a yaml file so we can search in Databricks itself.
